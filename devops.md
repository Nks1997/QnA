DEVOPS & CI/CD BASICS – Q&A
==============================

1. What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines Development and Operations to deliver software faster, reliably, and with automation.

2. Why DevOps is required?
To reduce deployment failures, improve collaboration, automate processes, and enable faster releases.

3. What are the key goals of DevOps?
Continuous integration, continuous delivery, faster feedback, reliability, scalability, and automation.

4. What is CI/CD?
CI/CD is a pipeline that automates code integration, testing, building, and deployment.

5. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
CI is the practice of frequently merging code into a shared repository and running automated builds and tests.

6. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
CD ensures code is always in a deployable state and can be released to production anytime.

7. What is Continuous Deployment?
Every code change that passes tests is automatically deployed to production without manual approval.

8. Difference between CI and CD?
CI focuses on integrating and testing code.
CD focuses on delivering or deploying code.

9. What are common CI/CD tools?
Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, Bamboo.

10. What is a pipeline?
A pipeline is an automated sequence of stages like build, test, scan, deploy.

11. What is version control?
Version control tracks changes in source code and helps collaboration.

12. Examples of version control systems?
Git, SVN, Mercurial.

13. Difference between centralized and distributed VCS?
Centralized: Single server (SVN)
Distributed: Each user has full copy (Git)

14. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used to manage source code.

15. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
IaC manages infrastructure using code instead of manual configuration.

16. Popular IaC tools?
Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates, Pulumi.

17. What is configuration management?
Managing and maintaining system configuration consistently.

18. Configuration management tools?
Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack.

19. Difference between Ansible and Terraform?
Ansible: Configuration management (push-based)
Terraform: Infrastructure provisioning (declarative)

20. What is cloud computing?
On-demand delivery of computing resources over the internet.

21. Cloud service models?
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.

22. Examples of cloud providers?
AWS, Azure, GCP.

23. What is containerization?
Packaging applications with dependencies into containers.

24. What is Docker?
Docker is a container platform to build, ship, and run containers.

25. Difference between VM and container?
VMs run full OS.
Containers share host OS and are lightweight.

26. What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform.

27. Why Kubernetes is used?
For container scaling, self-healing, load balancing, and automation.

28. What is monitoring?
Tracking system performance, availability, and health.

29. Monitoring tools?
Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor.

30. What is logging?
Collecting and analyzing application/system logs.

31. Logging tools?
ELK Stack, Splunk, Azure Log Analytics.

32. What is DevOps lifecycle?
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

33. What is automation in DevOps?
Replacing manual tasks with scripts and tools.

34. What is blue-green deployment?
Two environments: one live, one idle for zero-downtime releases.

35. What is canary deployment?
Releasing changes to a small set of users first.

36. What is rollback?
Reverting to previous stable version after failure.

37. What is SLA, SLO, SLI?
SLA: Agreement
SLO: Objective
SLI: Indicator

38. What is artifact?
A build output like JAR, WAR, Docker image.

39. What is repository?
A place to store source code or artifacts.

40. What is DevSecOps?
Integrating security into DevOps pipelines.
